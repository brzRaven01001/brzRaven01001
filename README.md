# About me

🔹 Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Murilo. I'm a 19-year-old college student currently in my third semester of Systems Analysis and Development. My first contact with computers was between 2007 and 2009, when I got my first PC and PlayStation 2 console! Since then, computers and video games have been a big part of my life. I finished high school in 2022 and had no doubts about the path I wanted to take Game Development!
I'm truly fascinated by how games work. Every time I play a game, I start wondering how many lines of code it takes to make everything function: voice acting, events, scenarios, conditions, and so much more! 🔹

# English level

## 🎓**I have a very solid and advanced English level, but I'm always trying to improve**🎓

🎯My very first game developed was a Craps Game in Python, due college exercises. In particular, I found my game amazing e satisfying to develop, although simple.
Therefore, I want to improve my knowledge and improve more and more! However, I decided to use C++ when game developing🎯

# Why using C++, not Python, since Python is easier to learn?
👨‍💻 C++ is the most widely used language in game development because it offers high performance and efficiency. Many major game engines, such as Unreal Engine, are built on C++, making it the preferred choice for professional game developers. 👨‍💻
